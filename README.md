# MedRoster — Backend API

**Blaze Studios** · MedRoster API

Standalone Express API for MedRoster. Authenticates requests with **Firebase Auth** ID tokens and stores hospital data in **Cloud Firestore**.

Consumed by the [web frontend](https://github.com/blaze308/medroster-frontend) and [Flutter app](https://github.com/blaze308/medroster-app).

## Stack

- **Node.js** + Express 4
- **Firebase Admin** (Auth + Firestore)
- Helmet, CORS, rate limiting

---

## Getting started

> **Firebase first:** Follow [FIREBASE_SETUP.md](../FIREBASE_SETUP.md) to create the Firebase project, enable Email/Password auth, and add the service account to `.env`.

1. Install dependencies:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

2. Create a `.env` in this folder:

   ```env
   PORT=4000
   ALLOWED_ORIGINS=http://localhost:3000

   FIREBASE_ADMIN_PROJECT_ID=
   FIREBASE_ADMIN_CLIENT_EMAIL=
   FIREBASE_ADMIN_PRIVATE_KEY="-----BEGIN PRIVATE KEY-----\n...\n-----END PRIVATE KEY-----\n"
   ```

   Use a Firebase service-account key. Escape newlines in `FIREBASE_ADMIN_PRIVATE_KEY` as `\n`.

3. Run:

   ```bash
   npm run dev    # watch mode
   npm start      # production
   ```

4. Health check: [http://localhost:4000/health](http://localhost:4000/health)

## Auth model

- `POST /api/auth/register` — creates a Firebase Auth user, hospital doc, and `users/{uid}` profile (role `admin`).
- All other `/api/*` routes require `Authorization: Bearer <Firebase ID token>`.
- Middleware resolves the caller's `hospitalId` from Firestore and scopes data access to that hospital.
